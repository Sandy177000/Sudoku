# Sudoku Game
The project is a game that allows the user to solve Sudoku puzzles.
The aim of the project is to recreate the experience of solving Sudoku puzzles that people used to do in newspapers.
The game consists of a 9x9 grid of boxes that can be filled with digits from 1 to 9.
The game has a reset button, an exit button, a solution button, and a check moves button.
The reset button empties the whole grid, the exit button closes the execution, the solution button fills the grid with expected solutions, and the check moves button checks whether the move is correct or not.
The game grid consists of 9 rows and 9 columns, which are buttons that can be clicked to fill the digit in the box.
The game is built from scratch, and it will be a combination of a 9x9 matrix of buttons.
